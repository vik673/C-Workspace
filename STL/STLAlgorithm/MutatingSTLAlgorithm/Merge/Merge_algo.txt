In C++, merge() function provides an efficient way to combine two sorted sequences into one sorted sequence. It is primarily used in Merge Sort sorting algorithm.

Syntax
The merge() function is defined in the <algorithm> header file and has the following syntax:

merge(first1, last1, first2, last2, result);

Parameters:

first1, last1: Iterators specifying the range of the first sorted sequence.
first2, last2: Iterators specifying the range of the second sorted sequence.
result: Iterator pointing to the beginning of the destination range where the merged elements will be stored.
Note: The output container should have enough space to accommodate all elements.
