C++ STL has an in-built container adaptor which implements the stack data structure internally.
We can directly use this container to implement stacks in our programs and perform
a number of operations available.

Insertion and Deletion in a stack are done from a single end which is the rear
end of the stack data structure.

Syntax:

stack<data_type> stack_name;
Note: The stack class is available in the header file <stack>. 
Therefore, one must include this header file in programs while using the stack class of C++ STL.
