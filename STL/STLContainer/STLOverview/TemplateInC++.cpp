/*
In C++, templates offer a way to write your code once and use it with various data types.
The basic idea is to write generic code for both primitive like (int, char, double) and non-primitive(user-defined) 
data types. When we pass specific data types to the template the compiler generates a code for that data type rather
 than write code for different data types.

There are two types of templates:

    Function Templates: Function templates are used for generic functions like sorting and searching algorithms.
    Class Templates: Class templates are similar to function templates but they are used to create generic data structures
    like stack, queue, dequeue, and etc.

Templates are essential to the Standard Template Library (STL), a cornerstone of C++ programming.
The STL provides a wealth of pre-built functions and classes (like vectors, lists, maps, and algorithms)
implemented as templates. This makes the STL incredibly versatile, as you can use these components with 
virtually any data type without having to rewrite them.

Templates are the basic concept of the Standard Template Library (STL) of C++ programming. STL containers are built 
internally using class templates and algorithm functions are built internally using function templates.
